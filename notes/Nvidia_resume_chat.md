# Cloud Developer - Remote, Germany - NVIDIA

## Description

NVIDIA has been transforming computer graphics, PC gaming, and accelerated computing for more than 25 years. It's a unique legacy of innovation that's fueled by great technology—and amazing people. Today, we're tapping into the unlimited potential of AI to define the next era of computing. An era in which our GPU acts as the brains of computers, robots, and self-driving cars that can understand the world. Doing what's never been done before takes vision, innovation, and the world's best talent. As an NVIDIAN, you'll be immersed in a diverse, supportive environment where everyone is inspired to do their best work. Come join the team and see how you can make a lasting impact on the world.

We have positions available for enthusiastic and experienced software developers for the development of cloud related functionality in our Linux-based cluster software environment. NVIDIA's Bright Cluster Manager is used to power thousands of Linux clusters around the world, varying from a few nodes to several thousands of nodes. Bright clusters can run on-premises, completely in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment.

## What you'll be doing:

Work on the integration of our product with public cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Google Cloud Platform.
Develop features that let organizations seamlessly extend their on-premises infrastructure into one or multiple public clouds and to migrate workload (including input/output data) from on-prem to the cloud.
Adding many new features to allow Bright clusters to be used for a wider range of workloads, and to allow clusters to scale to hundreds of thousands of nodes (i.e. exascale).
Following the latest developments in cloud technology.
Assist our support team with cloud specific support requests.
Work with the latest hardware (e.g. GPUs, accelerators, high-speed interconnects such as InfiniBand, 100 Gig-E) and software technologies such as parallel file-systems (e.g. Lustre, GPFS, BeeGFS, WekaIO), OpenStack, Docker, Kubernetes, Jupyter and Ceph.
There will be ample opportunity to develop your skills and to take initiative.

## What we need to see:

Degree in Computer Science or related field (or equivalent experience)
5+ years of experience in software development, preferably on Linux platforms
Fluent in C++ and/or Python and intimately familiar with object oriented software design, design patterns, and concurrent programming techniques.
The quality of your work is important to you, so you take pride in producing extremely clean code.
Our cluster management software is based on Linux. You should be very familiar with the Linux operating system and in particular with networking concepts in Linux. In addition, you are familiar with the most common software that is part of a typical Linux installation.
Eagerness to learn and use new technologies.

## Ways to stand out from the crowd:

Knowledge of Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, OCI, GCP, OpenStack, Jenkins and distributed programming would be beneficial, but is not strictly necessary.
Experience with high-performance computing and system administration would be an asset.
NVIDIA is widely considered to be one of the technology world's most desirable employers. We have some of the most brilliant and talented people in the world working for us. Are you creative, autonomous, and looking for a challenge? If so, we want to hear from you. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
```

ASSISTANT:
Thanks! Next I'll need to know more about you in order to write a compelling resume. Can you tell me about your work experience?

USER:
I'll send you my resume in tex format. This way you can extract the information you need.

Can you please tell me what skills you would miss as a hiring manager. What experience should I highlight more, what can I edit or leave out?

Please elaborate and write a revised version in markdown.

The goal of the revision is to make that resume land me an interview.

ASSISTANT:
Given the job description for the Cloud Developer position at NVIDIA and your current resume, here's my analysis:

## Key Areas to Highlight

1. **Cloud Experience and Skills:** The job description emphasizes the importance of integrating NVIDIA's product with various cloud platforms. Your experience with AWS is important here.
2. **Programming Languages:** They're specifically looking for C++ and/or Python. You have experience with both, which is great. These should be highlighted.
3. **Linux Networking Concepts:** You have Linux experience from your job roles, and this should be showcased, especially given the mention in the job description.
4. **Large-Scale Systems:** The mention of scaling to exascale clusters means experience with large systems and scalability is key. Your roles indicate work with large medical datasets and NLP models, which can relate to the required experience.

## Areas to Improve or Adjust

1. **Clearer Mention of Relevant Skills:** While you've used many tools and languages across your positions, make sure to emphasize those specifically mentioned in the job description or those that are closely related.
2. **Elastic Experience:** The use of Kibana and Elastic can be highlighted more given the probable large-scale data management and processing requirements of NVIDIA.
3. **Shorten or Remove Less Relevant Experience:** For instance, the signal processing role at sofasession GmbH might be less relevant compared to other experiences.

Tailoring your resume to match the specific requirements of the role while highlighting your strengths and accomplishments is key to standing out and securing an interview.

USER:
I think there is some relevant experience I could include.
I worked on a project that would do weight sharing among on-premise machine learning algorithms. For our customers it is important to retain HIPAA and GDPR compliance, so we had to make sure that any identifying information was not leaving the on-premise environment.
We used the flower framework for that. This was in my role as a senior software engineer at 3M.

Also I did gain experience in Jenkins at this role too. I was responsible for setting up the CI/CD pipeline for different projects.
