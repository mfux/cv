I was using C++ to develope low-latency audio processing components for the application. I also worked with git for source code management.
I also did some work on the web front-end in CSS, HTML and Javascript.
I worked in a team of international software engineers. But as I used my project there also for my masterthesis, I also had some responsibilities for my part of the project.
I took part in meetings discussing software problems. I developed the audio mixer for our application that was running in production. I was responsible for testing software and for communicating my results. I had to document everything as I did my project also for my bachelor thesis.
In testing I applied my learnings from university software engineering course and successfully discovered a number of bugs, which made me proud.
I was also happy to see the mixer that I had build in action during a big demo of the product.
Also I consider the trust I received from my boss as an achievement. He was very happy with my work which was reflected, that I was accepted to work there remotely for a few month after the internship had ended.
This Job was my first position as a software developer, I learned that it can be hard but that it is rewarding. I learned that interpersonal skills are important. And that my collegues view me as a peer :)
